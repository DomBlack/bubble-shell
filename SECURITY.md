## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

We greatly value the work of security researchers and believe that responsible disclosure of 
security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the safety and privacy of our users.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let
us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

### Vulnerability reporting process:

1. Email the lead maintainer at me [at] dom-black .co.uk. Include as much information as possible, including
   but not limited to; a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any proof of concept.

2. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

3. We'll confirm receipt of your vulnerability report and send you regular updates about our progress.
   
4. If you're interested, we are happy to acknowledge your contribution to our security in the README.md.

We strive to resolve all security issues in a reasonable timeframe - depending on the severity and complexity of the issue.
